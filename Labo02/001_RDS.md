# Create a database using the Relational Database Service (RDS)

In this task you will create a new RDS database that will replace the
MySQL database currently used by Drupal.

|Key|Value for GUI Only|
|:--|:--|
|Data type|Standard create|
|Engine options|Check your Drupal Instance|
|Template|Dev/Test|

### Security Check : Estimated Monthly Costs

Do you get the same values ?

|Key|Value for GUI Only|
|:--|:--|
|DB Instance|13.87 USD|
|Storage|2.66 USD|
|Total|16.53 USD|

* Copy the estimated monthly cost for the database and add it to your report.

```
//TODO
```

Note : AWS ask for add-on. Close it.

## Task 03 - Test whether the database can be reached from the Drupal Instance

### Get the RDS Endpoint (you need to wait few minutes after launching)

```bash
[INPUT]
//Try to get the same kind of output
```

```bash
[OUTPUT]
[...]
|||                                          Endpoint                                          |||
||+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+||
|||  Address         |  dbi-devopsteam[XX].xxxxxxxxxx.eu-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com              |||
|||  HostedZoneId    |  XXXXXXXXXXXXX                                                          |||
|||  Port            |  3306                                                                   |||
[...]
```

### Test the access to RDS from your Drupal Instance

```sql
[INPUT]
//help : mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u <rds_admin_user> -p

[OUTPUT]
```

### Questions:

* Compare the costs of your RDS instance to a continuously running EC2 
  instance of the same size using the [AWS calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/addService). (Don't forget to
  uncheck the **Free Usage Tier** checkbox at the top.)

```
//TODO
```

* In a two-tier architecture the web application and the database are
  kept separate and run on different hosts. Imagine that for the
  second tier instead of using RDS to store the data you would create
  a virtual machine in EC2 and install and run yourself a database on
  it. If you were the Head of IT of a medium-size business, how would
  you argue in favor of using a database as a service instead of
  running your own database on an EC2 instance? How would you argue
  against it?

```
//TODO
```

* Copy the endpoint of your RDS.
