* Become aware of costs

---

### TODO

* [Task 001 - Accesses](./001_Accesses.md)
* [Task 002 - Deploy Instance](./001_DeployInstance.md)

### Task 2: Create an Amazon EC2 instance

In this task you will create a new virtual machine with a preinstalled
operating system (Ubuntu) and you will login to the machine with an
administrator account. AWS calls virtual machines _EC2 Instances_.

Please read the following guide for reference: [Getting Started with
Amazon EC2 Linux
Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)

Once you have read the guide, please perform the following tasks:

* Launch an instance running **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD
  Volume Type**, architecture **x86**, instance type **t2.micro**.

    * Leave the instance details at their default settings.

    * Leave storage at its default settings.

    * In __Step5: Add Tags__ click on __name tag__ and name the
      instance, volumes and network interface according to the lab
      naming convention like this:

            GrF_Nicollier

    * Use the security group you have created earlier (ignore the
      warning about source 0.0.0.0/0).

    * Use the key pair you have created earlier.

* Observe how the instance is being created. How long does it take
  until its state is **running**?

* Login to your instance via SSH once it has been launched. AWS has
  created an account named **ubuntu** for you. To authenticate use the
  private key you have downloaded before. To get help on the available
  options for connecting, select the instance and choose **Connect**
  from the Actions menu.

  Tip: By default all ports on your Instance have been locked
  down. Ensure you have correctly setup the firewall on your instance
  to allow SSH (Port 22) in case you are having trouble in connecting.

* Poke around - Try out the following commands to explore the machine.

    * `id` - get info about the account you are logged in, including which groups you are a member of
    * `date` - show the timezone and the current time (notice something?)
    * `lsb_release -a` - get info about the Linux distribution
    * `sudo lshw -short` - display hardware (remember this is all virtual)
    * `lscpu` - display info about the CPU, the hypervisor and the virtualization type
    * `free -h` - display the total amount of memory and how much is used
    * `lsblk` - display disks and other block storage devices (ignore the loop devices)
    * `df -h` - display file systems, their size and how much space is used and available (ignore everything not starting with `/dev/xvd`)

  You can always install software packages that you need using the
  command `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt install
  package_name`. For example to install `tree` type `sudo apt install
  tree`.

**Deliverables:**

* What is the smallest and the biggest instance type (in terms of
  virtual CPUs and memory) that you can choose from when creating an
  instance?

* How long did it take for the new instance to get into the _running_
  state?

* From the **EC2 Management Console** copy the **public DNS** name of
  the instance into the report.

* Using the commands to explore the machine listed earlier, respond to
  the following questions and explain how you came to the answer:

    * What's the difference between time here in Switzerland and the time set on
      the machine?
    * What's the name of the hypervisor?
    * How much free space does the disk have?

* Try to ping the instance from your local machine. What do you see?
  Explain. Change the configuration to make it work. Ping the
  instance, record 5 round-trip times.

* Determine the IP address seen by the operating system in the EC2
  instance by running the `ifconfig` command. What type of address
  is it? Compare it to the address displayed by the ping command
  earlier. How do you explain that you can successfully communicate
  with the machine?

Note: Once you have completed this part, should you not want to
continue immediatley working on the next part, please stop your
instance - Do not leave your instance running idle for more than a few
hours.


### Task 3: Install a web application

In this part you will install a web-based content management system
(CMS), Wordpress. Wordpress can be used to create corporate web sites and
among its users are The New York Times Company, Ubisoft Québec, etc. Wordpress is
written in PHP and requires a web server in which to run. It makes use
of a relational database to store its data. In this case the web
server is Apache and the database is MySQL.

__Install LAMP stack__

We will run Wordpress on a classical LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL,
PHP). To install this base software :

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install lamp-server^

It is possible that a dialog box appears asking to restart some services. You can select all the services by checking the box with a `*` using the space bar and then press `Enter` to continue.

Change the configuration of the firewall to allow incoming HTTP
connections. In the **EC2 Management Console** navigate to the
instance. Scroll to the right until you see the **Security Group**
associated with the instance. Click on the security group. Add a rule
for HTTP connections coming from anywhere. The security group should
now have the following rules:

    TCP Port (Service) Source
    22 (SSH)           0.0.0.0/0
    80 (HTTP)          0.0.0.0/0

Verify that you can reach the Apache server on port 80 from the
browser on your local machine. Enter the public DNS name of the
instance into your web browser. You should see the following page:

> **It works!**  
> This is the default welcome page...

Note: Modern browsers choose by default to connect via HTTPS
(encrypted, port 443), not HTTP (not encrypted, port 80). To force the
browser to connect using HTTP, type the full URL in the address bar

    http://<public IP address>:80

__Download Wordpress__

Note: The following instructions are adapted from this AWS article: [Host a WordPress blog on Amazon Linux 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html)

We need to download the latest version of Wordpress and extract it.

    wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
    tar -xzf latest.tar.gz

__Set up the database__

We need to set up the MySQL database for Wordpress. First, ensure that the MySQL server is running:

    sudo systemctl start mysql

Then, we create a user and a database for Wordpress.

    sudo mysql
    mysql> CREATE USER 'wordpress-user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'wordpress-password';
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE `wordpress-db`;
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `wordpress-db`.* TO "wordpress-user"@"localhost";
    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    mysql> exit

__Configure Wordpress__

Wordpress uses a configuration file to set a bunch of parameters, such as the database connection. We need to copy the sample configuration file and edit it (we use the `nano` editor).

    cp wordpress/wp-config-sample.php wordpress/wp-config.php
    nano wordpress/wp-config.php

In the editor, find the lines below and replace them with as follows:

    define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress-db');
    define('DB_USER', 'wordpress-user');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', 'wordpress-password');

Then, copy the files to the Apache directory for site content and set the correct permissions.

    sudo cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www

Finally, enable Wordpress permalinks.

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

You need to find the block `<Directory /var/www/>` and change `AllowOverride None` to `AllowOverride All`.

Then, restart the Apache server.

    sudo systemctl restart apache2

__Install Wordpress__

Now, in your web browser, navigate to `http://<public IP address>:80/wp-admin/setup-config.php`. It will ask you to fill some information about the website. Feel free to choose whatever you want, as long as you remember the username and password. You can check the box to discourage search engines from indexing the site, as we don't want to be indexed by Google or other search engines (which is pretty unlikely to happen anyway).

When installation is finished you should see a functional Wordpress site.

* Start to use the newly created Wordpress site by creating a new page.

* Save your instance's IP somewhere and then, in the AWS console create an Elastic IP Address and attach it to the instance.

    * Click on **Elastic IPs** in the left navigation bar then click
      **Allocate New Address**.

    * To be able to find it later tag it with the key `Name` and as value put the lab naming convention like this:

            GrF_Nicollier

    * Select the newly created address and click on
      **Actions > Associate**. Select the Wordpress instance.

    * Unfortunatly, you will have to do a small modification in Wordpress because it is not aware of the new IP address. There is a tool called `wp-cli` that can help you with that. Install it and replace the IP with the following commands:

            curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
            php wp-cli.phar search-replace '<OLD_IP>' '<NEW_IP>' --path=/var/www/html/ --skip-columns=guid

* Ping the Elastic IP Address from your local machine. You may have to
  wait a few seconds until the address is associated. Using the browser
  navigate to the Wordpress start page by using the Elastic IP Address.

**Deliverables:**

* Add a screenshot of the page you created in Wordpress to the report.

* Add the Elastic IP Address you created to the report.

* Why is it a good idea to create an Elastic IP Address for a web site
  (our web application)? Why is it not sufficient to hand out as URL
  for the web site the public DNS name of the instance?

Note: Once you have completed this part, should you not want to
continue immediatley working on the next part, please stop your
instance - Do not leave your instance running idle for more than a few
hours. Also detach and release the Elastic IP Address.

### Task 4: Performance analysis of your instance

In this part you will run a benchmarking application on your
provisioned EC2 instance and your local machine to test compute
performance and memory throughput and compare the performance of the
instance with your local machine.

On your EC2 instance perform the following steps.

1. Download the Linux version of the Geekbench benchmark:

        curl -O http://cdn.primatelabs.com/Geekbench-3.3.0-Linux.tar.gz

2. Extract the files from the archive:

        tar -xvzf Geekbench-3.3.0-Linux.tar.gz

3. Install 32-bit compatibility libraries needed by Geekbench:

        sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install libc6:i386 libstdc++6:i386

4. Run the benchmarks:

        cd dist/Geekbench-3.3.0-Linux
        ./geekbench

    You should see output similar to this:

        Geekbench 3.3.0 Tryout : http://www.primatelabs.com/geekbench/

        Geekbench 3 is in tryout mode.
        [...]
        Running Gathering system information
        [...]
        Uploading results to the Geekbench Browser. This could take a minute or two 
        depending on the speed of your internet connection.
        [...]

**Deliverables:**

* Provide the URLs of the Geekbench results for the EC2 instance and
  your local machine.

* Provide system information about the EC2 instance.

* Provide the single-core and multi-core performance scores for
  overall, integer, floating-point and memory performance of the EC2
  instance.

* Provide system information about your local machine.

* Provide the single-core and multi-core performance scores for
  overall, integer, floating-point and memory performance of your
  local machine.

* Compare the overall scores of the two machines.

Note: Once you have completed this part, should you not want to
continue immediatley working on the next part, please stop your
instance - Do not leave your instance running idle for more than a few
hours.


### Task 5: Resource consumption and pricing

In this part you will determine how much Amazon charges customers for
using cloud resources.

* On the page [Amazon EC2 Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)
  read the section **On-Demand Instances**. Estimate how many hours
  your virtual machine instance was running.

* Navigate to the
  [AWS Simple Monthly Calculator](http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

* Uncheck the **FREE USAGE TIER** checkbox.

* Switch to the region in which you created the virtual machine.

* Add your instance to the calculator and enter the hours it was
  active. Also enter the capacity of the disk. Note the total cost
  given by the tab **Estimate of your Monthly Bill**. 

**Deliverables:**

* How much does your instance cost per hour? How much does your disk cost per hour? What was the cost for this lab (make an approximate guess)?
    * You will find hourly/monthly prices at the links below. Look up the prices for the region in which you created the instance.
    * Do not take into account the AWS free tier, only regular prices.
    * Show the details of your calculation.
    * [Prices for EC2 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#On-Demand_Pricing)
    * [Prices for EBS Volumes](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/): Choose the cheapest SSD

* Calculate the total cost of the configuration used in the lab if everything was running continuously in production during a whole month. Take additionally into consideration the resources below.
    * Show the details of your calculation.
    * [Prices for data transfer](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer): Consider the data transfer from the EC2 Instance to the users. Assume 100'000 visitors downloading 85 MB each.
    * [Prices for public IPv4 addresses](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/)

* The EBS Volume you created uses an SSD drive to store its data. When
  you buy an SSD drive at Digitec (
  https://www.digitec.ch/en/producttype/ssd-545) how much do you pay
  per TB? (Change the sort order to top-selling and look at the best
  selling model. Prices per TB are shown in gray.) How much does a 1
  TB ESB Volume cost for a month?

Note: Please stop your instance once you have completed this part - Do
not leave your instance running idle for more than a few hours.

### Task 6: Cleanup

Stop your instance. Don't terminate it, as you will need it for the next lab.

Release the Elastic IP Address.
